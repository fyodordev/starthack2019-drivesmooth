The pitch


## Loose sentences and terminology

- safety on the road, comfort for passengers as well as help save the environment by reducing emissions with a more economical way of driving
- Can make driving more fun and help you improve your driving skills.
- Data is transmitted to a server and can then be used for instance by insurance companies to more accurately assess risk and get a better deal for the customer.
- Feedback on your driving style
- Incentive to be more mindful of your driving style.
- using the accelerometer to detect jerky movements as well as acceleration forces exceeding a certain threshold


## Pitch


### Intro, which problems it solves and how

What if instead of trying to improve the machine, we help improve the driver. 

Our idea was to design an app that could give you feedback on your driving style. By using the accelerometer to detect jerky movements as well as acceleration forces exceeding a certain threshold the app gives you feedback on how smoothly and carefully you drive. Using a scoring system it incentivizes you to handle the car more carefully as well use more foresight on the road. This facilitates more safety on the road, comfort for passengers and reduces emissions because of a more economical way of driving.

### What we achieved

During the start hack, we have come up with a prototype that uses a graphical representation of the car's relevant movements, as well as a scoring system. While driving the red point shouldn't leave the circle, if it does the screen turns red. You also get an overall score on your driving style based on well you managed to stay within the circle.

### How this idea/project could be expanded further

There's a lot of ways we could expand this project further. For instance our data could used by insurance companies to more accurately assess driver risk which would also help the driver get a better deal.
